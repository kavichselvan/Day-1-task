Question:

Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that enables communication between web clients and servers. The latest versions of HTTP are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog, we will discuss the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of the HTTP protocol. It was released in 1999 and has been the backbone of the web for over two decades. Here are some of the key characteristics of HTTP/1.1:

Multiple requests: HTTP/1.1 requires multiple requests to be sent to the server to load a web page. This is because HTTP/1.1 can only process one request at a time.

Connection management: HTTP/1.1 uses a technique called "keep-alive" to manage connections between the client and the server. Keep-alive allows multiple requests to be sent over the same connection, which reduces the overhead of opening and closing connections.

Header compression: HTTP/1.1 does not have native support for header compression, which can lead to increased bandwidth usage and slower load times.

HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol. It was released in 2015 and was designed to address some of the limitations of HTTP/1.1. Here are some of the key characteristics of HTTP/2:

Single request: HTTP/2 can handle multiple requests simultaneously over a single connection. This is because HTTP/2 uses a technique called "multiplexing" to send multiple requests and responses over the same connection.

Stream prioritization: HTTP/2 allows clients to prioritize which requests should be processed first, which can lead to faster load times.

Header compression: HTTP/2 has native support for header compression, which can reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.

Conclusion

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are both important versions of the HTTP protocol. While HTTP/1.1 has been the backbone of the web for over two decades, HTTP/2 offers several improvements that make it a faster and more efficient protocol. As the web continues to evolve, it is likely that HTTP/2 will become the standard protocol for web communication.
