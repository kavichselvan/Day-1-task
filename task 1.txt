Question 1:

1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that enables communication between web clients and servers. The latest versions of HTTP are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog, we will discuss the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of the HTTP protocol. It was released in 1999 and has been the backbone of the web for over two decades. Here are some of the key characteristics of HTTP/1.1:

Multiple requests: HTTP/1.1 requires multiple requests to be sent to the server to load a web page. This is because HTTP/1.1 can only process one request at a time.

Connection management: HTTP/1.1 uses a technique called "keep-alive" to manage connections between the client and the server. Keep-alive allows multiple requests to be sent over the same connection, which reduces the overhead of opening and closing connections.

Header compression: HTTP/1.1 does not have native support for header compression, which can lead to increased bandwidth usage and slower load times.

HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the HTTP protocol. It was released in 2015 and was designed to address some of the limitations of HTTP/1.1. Here are some of the key characteristics of HTTP/2:

Single request: HTTP/2 can handle multiple requests simultaneously over a single connection. This is because HTTP/2 uses a technique called "multiplexing" to send multiple requests and responses over the same connection.

Stream prioritization: HTTP/2 allows clients to prioritize which requests should be processed first, which can lead to faster load times.

Header compression: HTTP/2 has native support for header compression, which can reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.

Conclusion

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are both important versions of the HTTP protocol. While HTTP/1.1 has been the backbone of the web for over two decades, HTTP/2 offers several improvements that make it a faster and more efficient protocol. As the web continues to evolve, it is likely that HTTP/2 will become the standard protocol for web communication.

Question 2:

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Answer:

In Javascript, objects are one of the fundamental data types. They are used to represent a collection of related data and functionality in a structured manner. In this blog, we will explore the internal representation of objects in Javascript.

An object in Javascript is an unordered collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. The keys are always strings, and the values can be any Javascript data type, including other objects. Properties can be added, removed, and modified dynamically at runtime.

The internal representation of an object in Javascript is based on the concept of a dictionary or a hash table. When an object is created, a hash table is created under the hood to store its properties. The hash table uses the keys of the properties as the index, and the values of the properties are stored at those indices.

When you access a property of an object, Javascript internally performs a hash table lookup to find the value associated with that property. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), which means that accessing a property of an object is a very efficient operation.

Javascript also has a concept called prototypes, which allows objects to inherit properties and functionality from other objects. When you access a property of an object, and that property is not present in the object itself, Javascript will look for that property in the object's prototype chain. The prototype chain is a linked list of objects, where each object has a reference to its prototype object.

In conclusion, objects in Javascript are implemented using hash tables, which provide efficient access to properties. The prototype chain allows objects to inherit properties and functionality from other objects, making Javascript a powerful and flexible programming language. Understanding the internal representation of objects is essential for writing efficient and effective Javascript code.
